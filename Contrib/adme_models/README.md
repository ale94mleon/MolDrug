# ADME models

The fitness model: `fitness_plus_admes.py` is able to use the models `hppb.jilib` and `clearence.jlib`.

The scripts `train_models.py`, `featurize.py` are used for the construction sof the models. `use_models.py` is a simple example on how to use the models. These three scripts were kindly provided by [Miha Skalic](https://github.com/miha-skalic). The class `Featurizer` and `Predictors` from `featurize.py` are integrated in `fitness_plus_admes.py`.

## Future models

Here  is a detail list of public data base to construct ADME models: [adme](https://tdcommons.ai/single_pred_tasks/adme/).
