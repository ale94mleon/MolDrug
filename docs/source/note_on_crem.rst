Note on CReM data base
======================

.. warning::

    For the tutorials we will use the CReM data base ``replacements02_sc2.db.gz``.
    This is just because is the smaller one and therefore it has the fast download.
    For real problems consider read first the `CReM paper <https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00431-w>`__
    and also see the discussion on `MolDrug repo <https://github.com/ale94mleon/MolDrug/discussions/6>`__
